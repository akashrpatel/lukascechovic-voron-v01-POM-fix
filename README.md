# voron-v01-POM-fix
Originally used for LDO v0.1 kit rev C Anti Backlash Nut, POM, Tr8X8, fix if you got Z binding-skipping on default Z motor current 0.37A, with good Z axis alignment

**Issue: Z motor is binding/skipping at default 0.37A current with empty bed, with properly aligned parts (Z leadscrewand  POM nut holder)**

hm.. increase Z motor amps to 0.5A-0.55A solve this but at the cost of grinding POM plastic part down and potentialy harm other parts of printer (head) as you really dont wanna super strong Z power (imagine Z endstop wont trigger)
